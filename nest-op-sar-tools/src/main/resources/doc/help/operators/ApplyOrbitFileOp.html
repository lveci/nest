<h3>Apply Orbit File Operator</h3>
<p>The orbit state vectors provided in the metadata of a SAR product are generally not accurate and can be refined
    with the precise orbit files which are available days-to-weeks after the generation of the product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The orbit file provides accurate satellite position and velocity information. Based on this information, the
    orbit state vectors in the abstract metadata of the product are updated.</p>

<h4>Orbit Files Supported</h4>
<p>The operator&nbsp;currently only supports ASAR and ERS products.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>For ASAR product, DORIS precise orbit file generated by the Centre de Traitement Doris Poseidon (CTDP)
        and Delft University can be applied. It provides the satellite positions&nbsp;and velocities in ECEF
        coordinates every 60 seconds.</li>
    <li>For ERS product, DELFT precise orbit file generated by Delft Institute for Earth-Oriented Space Research (DEOS)
        can be applied. It provides the satellite ephemeris information (latitude, longitude, height) every 60 seconds.
        The operator first converts the satellite position from (latitude, longitude, height) to&nbsp;ECEF coordinates,
        then computes the velocity information numerically.</li>
    <li>Also for ERS product, PRARE precise orbit file generated by Delft University can be applied. It&nbsp;provides
        the same information every 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Get Orbit Files</h4>
<ul>
    <li>DELFT orbit files can be downloaded automatically from the DELFT FTP server.</li>
    <li> DORIS and PRARE orbit files must be manually downloaded and placed in the folders specified in the&nbsp;
        <a href="../visat/SettingsDialog.html">settings</a> dialog.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Major Processing Steps</h4>
<p>To refine the orbit state vectors, the following steps are performed:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get the start time of the source product;</li>
    <li>Find orbit file with&nbsp;user specified type and&nbsp;the product start time;</li>
    <li>For each orbit state vector, get its zero Doppler time;</li>
    <li>Compute new orbit state vector with 8th order Lagrange interpolation using data for the 9&nbsp;nearest orbit
        positions&nbsp;around the zero Doppler time.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Important update and note on the orbit interpolation</h5>
<p>Since version v5.0.13, the interpolator used in the computation of the orbital state vectors was changed from Lagrange
    3th order, to the 8th order Lagrange interpolator. Also, instead of 4, in the interpolation, 9 nearest orbit positions
    are used. As a result, the orbit refinement is more reliable and consistent.</p>
<p> This update is especially important for the applications that are sensitive and dependent on the accurate SAR and
    orbital geometry, eg., interferometry, orthorectification, terrain correction, etc. It is strongly recommended, that
    all users, interested in these type of applications, do not use the version of software older then v5.0.13 for the
    orbital refinement, and upgrade to the latest version.
</p>

<h4>Parameters Used</h4>
<p>The following parameters are&nbsp;used by the operator:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Orbit Type: User can select the type of orbit file for the application. Currently the following orbit
        file types are supported:
        <ul>
            <li>DORIS_VOR</li>
            <li>DORIS_POR</li>
            <li>DELFT_PRECISE_ENVISAT</li>
            <li>DELFT_PRECISE_ERS_1</li>
            <li>DELFT_PRECISE_ERS_2</li>
            <li>PRARE_PRECISE_ERS_1</li>
            <li>PRARE_PRECISE_ERS_2</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
