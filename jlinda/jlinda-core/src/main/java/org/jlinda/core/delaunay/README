This is a quick repository to share sandbox code for Delaunay triangulation in JAVA.

 The code is designed having in mind future NEST(-DORIS) deployment, and triangulation
 interpolation. Specifically for handling large irregulary sampled grids of points, for
 example, radar-coded DEM.

 The implementation is motivated by OrbisGIS and JTS projects, and algorithmically follows
 concepts of Triangle tool by Jonathan  Shewchuk.

 The code is rather efficient, eg, on my i7 development box a 2D input array 1000000
 elements/coordinates is triangulated in ~4.0secs. It should be also thread-safe and
 NEST deployment friendly, though I haven't tested any of it yet. I expect to get a bit
 better benchmarks after minor refactoring.

 NOTE: I do not expect that the code will leave here for long. For more details follow
 regular NEST  development channels.
