<h3>Estimation and Subtraction of Topographic Phase</h3>

<p>
    This operator estimates and subtracts topographic phase from the interferogram.
    More specifically, this operator first radarcodes the Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
    of the area of interferogram, and then subtracts it from the complex interferogram.
</p>

<p>
    This operator has to be performed after the interferogram generation. It also requires
    an input DEM, SRTM can be used, or any other DEM supported by NEST. The DEM handling
    for most of elevation models, selection and download from internet of tiles covering
    the area of interest, interpolation, accounting for geoid undulation, etc, is performed
    automatically by the operator itself.
</p>

<p>
    A set of freely available, for the scientific use, digital elevation models are supported
    by NEST.
    <!--, as well as support for custom DEMs. -->
    The elevation models for which tiles are
    automatically handled by NEST are: SRTM, ACE, and GETASSE. For all others, some
    administration work is needed. Namely, a manual selection and download of tiles
    covering the area-of-interest has to be performed; while interpolation and pre-processing
    of DEM for interefometric applications is also performed automatically by the operator.
    <!--Note, that the "External DEM" should be in the WGS84 system (or in the same reference as-->
    <!--the orbit ephemerides).-->
</p>

<h4>Implementation Details</h4>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note that interpolation of DEM is conceptually different then in other Geometry NEST operators</span>
    (eg. Range Doppler Terrain Correction Operator).</p>

<p>The DEM reference phase is computed in two steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        In first step, the DEM is radarcoded to the coordinate systems of the master
        image. Per DEM point the master coordinate (real valued) and the
        computed reference phase is saved to a file.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then, the reference phase is interpolated to the integer grid of master
        coordinates. A linear interpolation based on a Delaunay triangulation is used.
        Dealunay Triangulation library, developed specifically for NEST and SAR applications is used.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Operator parameters:</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Orbit Interpolation Degree:</b> Degree of orbit interpolation polynomial.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Digital Elevation Model:</b> Elevation model to be used for the processing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Elevation Band Name:</b> Name of the elevation band, where interpolated and
        radarcoded height of the area-of-interest will be saved.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Source bands:</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p> Source Bands are stack of flat-earth subtracted ("flattened") interferograms.</p>

<h4>Output bands:</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p> Output Bands are stack of interferograms with subtracted DEM reference phase and other optional bands,
    for example: radarcoded elevation of the area, of topographic phase.
