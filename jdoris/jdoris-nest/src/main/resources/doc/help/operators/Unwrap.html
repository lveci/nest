<h3>Phase Unwrapping in NEST</h3>

<p>
    Here the procedure of phase unwrapping in NEST is described. This procedure is currently not implemented in NEST.
    However while a dedicated unwrapping modules for NEST are expected to be released by the end of 2012.
</p>

<p>
    To obtain the unwrapped interferogram, a 3rd party software should be used. The recommended tool to perform the
    phase unwrapping is the "Statistical-Cost, Network-Flow Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping" (SNAPHU), that can be
    downloaded from http://www-star.stanford.edu/sar_group/snaphu/). The restricted license of this software
    prevented a direct integration in NEST, so from the user is expected to download and install this, or other,
    software for the phase unwrapping individually.
</p>

<p>
    If the SNAPHU program is being used, please refer to the SNAPHU project web-site, and read the corresponding manual.
    Within NEST only a data export/import tools are provided for the user convenience.
</p>

<p><b><i>(More details and tutorial on how to use SNAPHU and do 3-pass DInSAR with NEST are COMING SOON!
    For updates please refer to the project web-site)</i></b></p>
